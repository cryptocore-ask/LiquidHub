# Safe Post-Deployment Setup

## Overview

After deploying all Liquid Hub contracts, the following Gnosis Safe multisig transactions must be executed to configure the system. Each step requires 2-of-3 signer approval.

Use the **Transaction Builder** app in the Gnosis Safe UI. For each step, paste the contract address, the JSON ABI, select the function, and fill in the parameters.

## Prerequisites

- All contracts deployed (MultiUserVault, RangeManager, Treasury, SecureBotModule, AaveHedgeManager if DN).
- All contract addresses recorded.
- Gnosis Safe multisig operational with 2/3 signers.

---

## Step 1: Enable SecureBotModule on Safe

Enable the bot module so it can execute whitelisted transactions through the Safe.

**Contract:** Safe (your multisig address)

```
Safe.enableModule(SAFE_MODULE_ADDRESS)
```

**ABI:**
```json
[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"module","type":"address"}],"name":"enableModule","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]
```

---

## Step 2: Set Bot Module on Vault

Register the module address on the vault so it can be recognized as an authorized bot.

**Contract:** MultiUserVault (`VAULT_ADDRESS`)

```
MultiUserVault.setBotModule(SAFE_MODULE_ADDRESS)
```

**ABI:**
```json
[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"_botModule","type":"address"}],"name":"setBotModule","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]
```

---

## Step 3: Authorize Module as Executor on RangeManager

Allow the module to call authorized functions on the RangeManager through the vault.

**Contract:** MultiUserVault (`VAULT_ADDRESS`)

```
MultiUserVault.authorizeExecutorOnRangeManager(SAFE_MODULE_ADDRESS, true)
```

**ABI:**
```json
[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"executor","type":"address"},{"internalType":"bool","name":"authorized","type":"bool"}],"name":"authorizeExecutorOnRangeManager","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]
```

---

## Step 4: Setup RangeManager Safe Authorization

Configure the RangeManager to recognize the Safe as an authorized caller.

**Contract:** MultiUserVault (`VAULT_ADDRESS`)

```
MultiUserVault.setupRangeManagerSafeAuthorization()
```

**ABI:**
```json
[{"inputs":[],"name":"setupRangeManagerSafeAuthorization","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]
```

---

## Step 5: Authorize RangeManager on Treasury

Allow the RangeManager to trigger keeper bounty payments from the Treasury.

**Contract:** Treasury (`TREASURY_ADDRESS`)

```
Treasury.authorizeRangeManager(RANGEMANAGER_ADDRESS, true)
```

**ABI:**
```json
[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"_rangeManager","type":"address"},{"internalType":"bool","name":"_authorized","type":"bool"}],"name":"authorizeRangeManager","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]
```

---

## Step 6: Configure Price Oracles

Set the Chainlink price feed addresses used by the RangeManager for position calculations.

**Contract:** RangeManager (`RANGEMANAGER_ADDRESS`)

```
RangeManager.configurePriceFeeds(TOKEN0_ORACLE, TOKEN1_ORACLE, ETH_ORACLE)
```

**ABI:**
```json
[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"_token0Oracle","type":"address"},{"internalType":"address","name":"_token1Oracle","type":"address"},{"internalType":"address","name":"_ethPriceOracle","type":"address"}],"name":"configurePriceFeeds","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]
```

---

## Step 7: Configure Initial Ranges

Set the initial range percentages for the LP position (e.g., 500 = 5% up, 500 = 5% down from current price). Values are in basis points of percent (100 = 1%).

**Contract:** RangeManager (`RANGEMANAGER_ADDRESS`)

```
RangeManager.configureRanges(rangeUpPercent, rangeDownPercent)
```

**ABI:**
```json
[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint16","name":"_rangeUpPercent","type":"uint16"},{"internalType":"uint16","name":"_rangeDownPercent","type":"uint16"}],"name":"configureRanges","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]
```

---

## Notes

- **All steps require Safe multisig approval** (2-of-3 signers must sign each transaction).
- Steps should be executed in order, as later steps may depend on earlier configuration.
- For **Delta Neutral (DN) pools**, additional AAVE-specific setup may be required, such as calling `supplyAndBorrow()` to establish the initial hedge position.
- After completing all steps, run the keeper in check-only mode (`npm run check`) to verify the configuration is correct before enabling automated rebalancing.
