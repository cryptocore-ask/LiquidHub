# Liquid Hub Protocol

Decentralized liquidity management protocol.

## Overview

Liquid Hub automates range management: dynamic range setting, permissionless rebalancing, multi-user vaults with fair share accounting, and protocol fee collection via an on-chain Treasury.

Two pool types are supported:
- **Standard** — Directional LP exposure
- **Delta Neutral (DN)** — LP exposure hedged via AAVE V3 (supply USDC collateral, borrow WETH)

## Architecture

| Contract | Description |
|---|---|
| **MultiUserVault** | Multi-user vault managing deposits, withdrawals, share accounting, and LP position lifecycle |
| **RangeManager** | Uniswap V3 price range management, on-chain swaps via SwapRouter, permissionless rebalancing |
| **RangeOperations** | Library for tick/range calculations |
| **SecureBotModule** | Gnosis Safe module whitelisting specific function selectors for automated operations |
| **Treasury** | Protocol fee collection, keeper bounties, admin withdrawals with monthly cap, LayerZero bridge (Phase 2) |
| **AaveHedgeManager** | *(DN only)* AAVE V3 hedge: supply/borrow, flash loan settlement, health factor monitoring |

## Getting Started

To run a keeper bot, see [docs/KEEPER-GUIDE.md](docs/KEEPER-GUIDE.md).

For post-deployment Safe configuration, see [docs/SAFE-SETUP.md](docs/SAFE-SETUP.md).

## Security

All admin functions are controlled by a Gnosis Safe 2/3 multisig. The keeper bot can only execute whitelisted operations through the SecureBotModule. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for details.
